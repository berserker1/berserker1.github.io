<hr />
<p>First of all the student guide <strong>[2]</strong> should have explained to you clearly ( please read it if you have not ) what you have to go through and when. There are different phases of GSoC and the guide explains it all step by step. So I will basically just write an overview here.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Most importantly there are various requirements[3] a student has to fulfill then only he will be eligible to participate.</strong></li>
  <li>So overall GSoC in short is:
    <ul>
      <li>Selecting your organization and working under a project of it.</li>
      <li>Submitting your proposal which has various details regarding you and your approach towards your project.</li>
      <li>If your proposal gets accepted then you work for it for the next 2-3 ( I do not know exact so sorry ) months with proper evaluations scheduled from time to time.</li>
      <li>Receive money for the work you did.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Google releases a timeline explaining the upcoming year‚Äôs GSoC a few months earlier than the program is going to start.
    <ul>
      <li>First there is a period when various organizations apply ( organization vary a lot, many new organizations will be there participating first time and many oldtimers which are participating from last 3-4 times ). Google has a separate guide on how to apply for them as well. Google filters and select some of them.</li>
      <li>Then Google reveals the selected organizations, for a student participating in this program this is where you will enter.</li>
      <li>Each organization revealed will have a short description, its GSoC introduction page where it will point to the various important details and links for one to start working in this organization, link to its discussion forums, prequisites for each of the projects and also a list of projects to work upon for this year‚Äôs GSoC under that organization. Each project will have some mentor assign to it whom the students can refer to for that project related queries at least.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Students see the list of of accepted organizations.
    <ul>
      <li>The target for the student is to submit a proposal ( max upto 3 but only 1 will be selected ) for a project under some organization before the deadline and also before this deadline he has to contribute some work to this organization ( like some bug fixes at the least ) so that the organization should be somewhat confident with the abilities of the student.</li>
      <li>One of the major hurdles the student faces is selection of the organization to work upon. This issue is definitely common and many approaches to tackle it have been provied by people online. I am just summarising the most notable ones.
        <ul>
          <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">If some students have some preference in a programming language then they can filter organization like that</code> <strong>but beware</strong> ‚Äì&gt; Doing some online course in 2-3 days of that language and selecting an organization on it is not the right way. Short online courses on programming languages does not make one proficient in it ( only experience does ) and the organization which builds its projects under this language will exhaustively use all of the language features and concepts. There is a pretty high chance you will be overwhelmed at first but then again the reward is also big and your learning curve will be steep, after the end of your program you will be sort of experienced developer in the language.</li>
          <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Choose organization based on an interest in a specific field</code>. This approach is also common and better than the above if you want to excel in your field of interest than just obtaining the GSoC tag. Many of my friends applied ( many got selected also‚Ä¶STUDS! ) in the organization <a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia</a> which actually is a programming language dealing with various scientific computation algorithms ( applying deep learning models for example ) with operations obtaining almost C like performance ( if done right ). Most of them applied here cause they had studied somewhat and wanted to explore more in the field of Deep-Learning, Natural Language Processing ( and other buzzwords you can think of ) etc. What good about this approach is unless you are exceptional in your field of interest your learning curve will be definitely be steep regardless of the fact that you get or do not get selected.</li>
          <li>One good thing about this program is that you can see anytime past year‚Äôs accepted organizations, their projects, whom they accepted, the projects upon which the accepted students worked and their individual proposals. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Some students use the benefit of excess time and information by looking up for organizations that are recurring for 2-3 years ( because it has a high chance of acceptance in this year as well ) and apply the above mentioned approaches as soon as timeline is released.</code> This hybrid approach certainly benefits if you have time beforehand because much is learned and much mistakes are rectified beforehand. If people in the organization will see you doing some contributions and then they see you applying their organization during the GSoC phase, the likelihood of your acceptance is much higher than the others because they are comfortable with working with you. The problem arises when the organization is not accepted this time despite it being accepted 2-3 times ( or more than that ) previously ( this happened to me this time and trust me it is not that rare ). Well then you just take your skillset to some other organization cause the skills you gained cannot be lost.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>If there are any prerequisites of GSoC then I would say it depends upon which approach ( among the above 3 ) you are following.</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>If it is the 1st one then just a proficiency in the language and also how to contribute to open source.</li>
      <li>For the 2nd method, it will definitely be your knowledge in that field, your proficiency in the programming language you use in that area and knowledge about how to contribute in open source.</li>
      <li>Since the third approach is the hybrid of above 2 you will definitely need at least one of the above mentioned prerequisites but there is a catch, since you are starting early even if you do not know anything you can just start understanding the prerequisites then only and be proficient in them.</li>
      <li><strong>One important thing to notice is that the ‚Äúfamiliarity with contribution to open-source‚Äù is common in all the prequisites.</strong> This actually is a must regardless of anything. It means understanding the basic idea of open-source ( just for aesthetic reasons, do not do it if you do not want to do it ), familiarity with a version control system ( <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> being the most famous one, mine organization use <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">Gitlab</a> which is just some more tweaks to git ) and how to contribute to different open-source projects which are maintained by the version control system.</li>
      <li><strong>Along with the above point one more must prerequsite is the ability to ask smart and informed questions.</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>You must realize the fact that the people of that organization are busy people ( even if they are not which is highly unlikely, you must assume this hypothesis for your own safety ). If you ask for spoonfeeding they will judge you ( sorry ) and ignore you. For example asking in the forum <em>Hello I am here for GSoC, how to start</em> is bad, really bad, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">so bad that it can be a meme-content!</code> The organization is selected for GSoC so its natural for it to have <em>GSoC starter guide</em> page, <em>How to contribute here</em> page and <em>various FAQs</em>, asking this question means shows you have not read any of it and indirectly you just ignored all their hardwork ( no f*** given at all ). This sometime ( mostly ) bugs them off.
So they do nothing to you, meaning they ignore you! ( take that you attention seeker ).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Most of the things are summarized above regarding what and hows if you are starting for GSoC. I have mentioned some links below regarding places where you can read more and form a more informed opinion because a summary is not enough and also where you can learn some of the important prerequisites.</p>
