<h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>

<p>I am a third-year undergraduate student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering in IIT Kharagpur. This is my personal blog where I would like to share various things I feel are important enough to share. 
For more details see the repository of this blog here <strong>[1]</strong> and see the <strong>README</strong>.<br />
I am a usually a fun ( at least that is what I think ) person to hang around, who gets serious for work at the 12th hour. If you talk about technology, manga, sci-fi, hacking, research and some other things, I will listen to you at least. Just feel free to not disturb me when you find time!.</p>
