[GNU Mailman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Mailman) is a free software under the GNU Project, it is licensed under the GNU General Public License. This software basically manages various electronic mailing lists and provides lots of features on how to handle them. Mailman has been a regular organization under the GSoC project.
The current maintainer of this project and one of my mentors is Abhilash Raj (handle: [maxking](https://asynchronous.in)).

It has been very fortunate for me to do my part in improving the GNU ecosystem and making it better by bits. Below are the links to my contributions to the organisation during GSoC 2019.

GNU has given me a community I love and I shall be a part of the organisation even after GSoC has been over and keep contributing in form of opinion, suggestions, code and guiding new contributors.

`Cheers`
