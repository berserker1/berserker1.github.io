According to the Google itself
>Google Summer of Code is a global program focused on introducing students to open source software development. Students work on a 3 month programming project with an open source organization during their break from university.

Basically it is a great initiative by google which helps students across various institutions across the world to learn and enter the field of open-source development with various open-source organizations.

- Organizations vary a lot specifically in terms of their field of expertise.You can definitely expect an organization related to your field of interest (what I mean is all field of interests directly or indirecty related to computer science) here.
- Students can choose and org relatd to their interest and their work will have a global impact, meaning you get to work on the products of an organization used by many other developers, so your work will benefit a lot of people. This can be somewhat called as coolness of open-source!.
- This program is globally recognized and working under this will definitely leverage your skills as well as your recognition.
- Many other perks which do not need much mentioning but definitely are important, are there also like
  - Your develop the habit of reading.
  - You ask questions in a better and an informed way and you learn how to communicate effectively with people without wasting anyone's time.
  - You learn a lot of skills; even if you are working in your field of interest, most likely the company working in that field will be well versed in that area and you may be overwhelmed at first, but you can learn (I would like to use "devour" more to express my feelings as compared to "learn") many concepts and ideas, you will really grow and be sort of an experienced person in that area.
- Not so much necessary to mention but you also get a stipend. This time its 3000USD (if I pass the whole program) for me.
