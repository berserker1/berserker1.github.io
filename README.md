# My Blog

This is a blog related to certain things which fall under these categories.

- **Say something**
  - Sometimes I go berserk!
- **Express concepts and ideas**
  - Different concepts technical/non-technical, how I see them, what they mean to me, what they mean to everybody else according to me.
- **Share what I know** 
  - Some experience I gained, the process ( in short ) I had to go through to learn it and what the reader should know from all of this to help him save its time and not go through the same journey ( possibly have a better one ).
## Rule which I follow

**(Post is on the blog)**  *if and only if*  **( (At least one of the above category the post falls under)** *and* **(Post does not have a category not mentioned above) )**
## Theme

The theme I took from [this](https://github.com/victorvoid/space-jekyll-template) awsome repo.

 - A simple spacemacs template on jekyll [here](https://victorvoid.github.io/space-jekyll-template/).
