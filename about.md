## About Me

I am a third-year undergraduate student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering in IIT Kharagpur. This is my personal blog where I would like to share various things I feel are important enough to share. 
For more details see the repository of this blog here **[1]** and see the **README**.  
I am a usually a fun ( at least that is what I think ) person to hang around, who gets serious for work at the 12th hour. If you talk about technology, manga, sci-fi, hacking, research and some other things, I will listen to you at least. Just feel free to not disturb me when you find time!.  

### Important highlights

- If you want to discuss manga, anime, movies, things like that with me.
  - Post on my disqus acccount mostly, never on github or on the blog if you know that I do not know you.
  - If you know that I know you then post on messenger also.

- If hacking or tech related stuff.
  - Post on reddit if you know that I do not know you.
  - You can post on messenger also if you know that I know you.

- If there is a problem you find with this blog, please open an issue in the repo **[1]** and try to give the appropriate solution to it as well ( appreciated a lot ).
